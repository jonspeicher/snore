snore
=====

snore is a Snarl plugin for nose.

Description
-----------

Writing Python?  Stuck on Windows?  Get your TDD on with snore.  snore plugs in to the nose test runner and uses the [Growl](http://growl.info)-alike Snarl to provide immediate feedback for your test results.  It is most fun and effective with a continuous test runner like [autonose](http://github.com/gfxmonk/autonose).

Requirements
------------

* Snarl (http://www.fullphat.net)
* PySnarl (http://code.google.com/p/pysnarl)
* nose (http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose)

I've tested snore with Snarl 2.21, PySnarl 1.0.2, and nose 0.11.1 on Windows XP Professional SP2 and on **nothing else**.

Installation
------------

First, install the required dependencies.  Snarl must be installed according to its instructions.  nose can be retrieved and installed with `easy_install nose`.  To install PySnarl, download and unzip the source and run `setup.py install` from the unzipped source's root directory.
